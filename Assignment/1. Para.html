        <br />
        London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a
        metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.
        <br />
        <br />
        Standing on the River Thames, London has been a major settlement for two millennia, its history going back to
        its founding by the Romans, who named it Londinium.
